# ROI-tSSS
Implementation of the tSSS algorithm for brain regions of interest

For a good place to start I would suggest going through the function rsquared_phantom. This will require the SPM toolbox and the SPM DAiSS toolbox. Phantom data can be downloaded here: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/phantom090715_BrainampDBS_20150709_01_ds_zip/4042911.
